<!-- What, did you come here expecting a real fucking store? Nah mate, you've been jipped, cajoled,
tricked, decieved, and possibly even bamboozled beyond the belief of humanity, you utter fool!
What would we even sell, modded iPods? Dankmus merch? I mean sure, we've got the guy from EliteObsolete
pretty much on tap, he could help us out with what the fuck we should sell, and where to get stock,
but fuck man, just ask him how hard it is to set up your own website FROM SCRATCH that can do e-commerce.
It's so hard his domain doesn't even link to his own website, it's just his eBay page!
Do you know how hard it is to set up a legitimate digital storefront? Billing, security, actual sensible fucking BROWSING?
Nah mate, that's what squarespace is for, they're the place to go for a BEAUTIFUL fucking website without a whole lot of hassle.
They've got fucking 24/7 support via live chat and email, and all of their templates feature responsive design so your site can look
great, no matter what device you're running it on, even that iPod Mini you're so obsessed with for some reason.
They've got tons of great features like, oh I dunno, fucking commerce built into their website. Y'know, fuck this sponsor spot,
unless Linus Media Group uses Squarespace for lttstore.com, you could very well go ask THEM how hard it is just to have a
functional enough fucking website to sell their merch. Anyways, rant over, if you actually read all of this,
then you're a goddamn legend mate, and are worthy of GEIR -->
